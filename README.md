# ElectriCars - Electric Cars Rental

## Description

This app was created with two purposes in mind. For those who are concerned about our future and want to take care of the environment. Also, most people have never had contact with an electric car and are interested in buying one. Renting an electric car can be a good option to help buyers make a decision. You can go for a test drive, but a ride around the block will not tell you much.
